# Detailed Structure

#### Data and Information
- Data
- Information
- What can we do with data?
- Forming insights
- Data to Information

#### Image models
- Raster and vector images
- What are images made of?
- Time spent on campus - Rasagy's map of entry, exit
- Sky maps over covid

#### Text models
- Qualitative vs. quantitative aspects (word counts, context, sentiment).
- Challenges of analyzing unstructured text.
- Word clouds, phrase nets, topic modeling visualizations
- Leveraging NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques for deeper insights.

#### Exploring data
- Dimensions in data
- Basic Stats
- Spreadsheets for exploring data
- Identifying outliers and trends
- Simple visualisations inside spreadsheets
- Measures of central tendency - mean, median, mode
- Frequency
- Exploratory Data Analysis - Techniques like box plots, histograms, scatter plots to uncover insights.
#### Graphical Perception
- Role of aesthetics, clarity, and function in effective visuals.
- How structure influences the visualization form
	- tree diagrams, node-link diagrams
	- Bar, line, pie, scatter plots, etc.
	- Minimizing visual clutter and maximizing data-ink ratio
	- Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, Proximity
	Accuracy of Different Chart Types - Cleveland and McGill studies on how people interpret lengths, angles, and areas.
- **Visual Encoding:** Color, Shape, Size
- Color wheels, complementary, analogous, triadic color schemes.
- Color for cartography
- Perceptual aspects of color (simultaneous contrast, color blindness considerations).
- **Visual Design:** Typography, Spacing, Emphasis
- Plane graphic
- Negative space
- Ben Schneiderman’s Visualization Mantra: “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand.”
#### Infographics
- What separates illustrations from infographics?
#### Lying with Data
- Ethics in Data Visualisation
- Data bias - where can it come from
- Histories - data x design, staged photographs
- Misleading graphics
- Common fallacies
- Spurious correlations
#### Storytelling with data
- Structuring data narratives with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Who is this for?
- New York Times interactive visual stories.
- Gapminder (Hans Rosling) for data-driven storytelling.
- Finding datasets
- Exploring datasets
- Finding insights
#### Geospatial visualisations
- Mapping and cartography
- History of maps
- Relevant [xkcd: Map Projections](https://xkcd.com/977/)
- With a large enough sample size everything is a population map [xkcd: Heatmap](https://xkcd.com/1138/) [\[OC\] Geospatial density of the biggest fast food chains in the USA : r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/zkercv/oc_geospatial_density_of_the_biggest_fast_food/)
- Exercise: Making a map
- Contributing to OpenStreetMap
- Projections (Mercator, Robinson, etc.), scale, and symbolization.
- Mapping statistical data (choropleth, proportional symbol maps).

#### Motion in Data Visualisations
- What can motion add?
- Shows temporal trends effectively.
#### Interactive Data Dashboards
- Engages users, allows exploration of data from different angles. Encourages personal discovery and deeper insight.
- Data Interfaces
- Sci fi interfaces
