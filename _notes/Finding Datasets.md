### [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

Kaggle is a Community for Machine Learning and Data Science. There are many datasets available for free. It leans towards AI/ML applications but the data can just as well be used for Data Visualisation purposes.

Kaggle also has some code-focused tutorials for Data Visualisation. See [Learn Data Visualization \| Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization)

### [data.gov.in](https://www.data.gov.in/)

Open Government Data (OGD) Platform run by the Indian government. It provides a single point of access to Datasets/Apps in open formats published by Ministries/Departments. This is great for finding India specific data.

### [data.gov](https://data.gov/)

Similiar government website for US specific data.

### [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/README.md)

Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project organized by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/). They release a dataset every Monday with a goal of providing real-world datasets so that people can learn to work with data.

P.S. They also have a [Podcast](https://www.tidytuesday.com/)!
