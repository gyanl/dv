### For Jekyll Garden

This website uses [Jekyll-Garden](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io), a theme for Jekyll created by [Hiran Venugopalan](https://github.com/hfactor)that can be used with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a public notes solution.

Here's the source code for my version of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/gyanl/dv). The website format is open source.
