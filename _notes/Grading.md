## Data Visualization Course Grading Plan

### Assessment and Grading Breakdown

Your performance in this course will be evaluated across four components, each designed to assess your participation, understanding, and practical application of data visualization concepts discussed in the class.

#### 1. Attendance (20%)

Attendance reflects your consistent engagement with the course and is recorded for both the Morning Session (10:30 AM - 12:30 PM) and the Afternoon Session (1:30 PM - 3:30 PM) each Tuesday.

- Attendance cut-off times: 11:00 AM for the morning session and 2:00 PM for the afternoon session.

- Each remaining session (10 lecture days and 20 sessions) contributes 1% to your overall grade.

While no distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences, documented emergencies can be discussed with the instructor. Late arrivals will not receive attendance credit but can still participate in class activities, which are graded separately as class presentations. 

#### 2. Class Presentations (25%)

Throughout the course, you will deliver presentations showcasing your ability to communicate data insights effectively.

- You will present visualizations, techniques, and analyses related to course content during designated weeks.

- Your top five scores (out of 10) will be averaged to determine your presentation grade. Each presentation will be graded on a 5-point system.

#### 3. Midterm Project (25%)

The midterm project is a group project, due mid-March, and focuses on exploratory data visualization.

All project ideas must be approved by me at least two weeks prior to the submission deadline to ensure sufficient guidance.

Team projects, of course, encourage collaboration. You are encouraged to work together on all parts of the project, and must ensure that every team member is involved in all aspects of the project (design, coding, and documentation). Although the team will receive a single grade, each team member will be asked to identify their own work product to ensure equitable division of labor. 

#### 4. Final Project (30%)

The final project is an individual project, due during the first week of May, and focuses on developing a real-world data visualization solution.

Final project ideas must be approved by me at least four weeks before the submission deadline to ensure you receive adequate guidance.

### Explanation:

Grading Scale

Grades will be assigned based on the following scale:

- A: 90-100%

- B: 80-89%

- C: 70-79%

- D: 60-69%

- F: Below 60%

### Academic Integrity

All submissions must be original and properly cite any third-party materials used, including datasets and code fragments. For group projects, the contributions of each team member must be clearly documented. Violations of academic integrity will be handled according to institutional policies.
