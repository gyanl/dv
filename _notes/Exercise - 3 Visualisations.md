### Reference

The [Data Viz Project](https://datavizproject.com/) has a collection of data visualizations to get inspired and find the right type for your use case.

They also have a project called [1 dataset. 100 visualizations.](https://100.datavizproject.com/) which visualises a small table in 100 different ways.

| Year | Norway | Denmark | Sweden |
|-----:|-------:|--------:|-------:|

| 2022 | 8      | 10      | 15     |

### Instructions

Find a small table of data that has at least 2x3 cells of data. Use the types of visualisations listed in the Data Viz Project to find 3 different ways to visualise this data. Try and use unusual ways to represent the data, if you can come up with something that's not in the website that's a bonus.

Here are some examples of tables:
